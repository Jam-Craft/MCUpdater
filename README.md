Minecraft Modpack Updater
====
This is a Minecraft mod utility, installed as a tweak, to automatically download or update mods in a modpack. It doesn't rely on Minecraft code, so it should be compatible with all versions.

It works similarly to VoxelUpdate, but with key differences.  Namely, forge compatibility and the ability to specify an absolute URL instead of a relative one.
